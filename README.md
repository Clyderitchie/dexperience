# DEXPERIENCE

## Description

Our motivation was to provide the user a personal experience with the Pokédex.  
Pokédexes can feel so automated, but our app adds a bit more of a personal flare that makes it fun, such as silly fun facts generated that were originally Chuck Norris facts, along with a mini-game and a journal.  
Accordingly, we combined the usage of two APIs to achieve this -- PokeAPI and a Chuck Norris one.  
  
Motivation also came from all of the knowledge we had acquired so far and wanting to implement them in useful and creative ways. In being driven to achieve this, we also learned plenty of things along the way!  

We learned how to use datalists to help autocomplete or provide recommendations for the user's searches, how to generate something new every day automatically (via the Pokemon of the Day feature), how to implement new CSS techniques we were not privy to before, such as 3D transforming and floating/typing animations.  
However, most importantly, we learned to think even more like coders.  
It is a great achievement to figure how to write to the computer what actions you desire to take place -- realizing more than ever why placement matters and when to use certain methods and statements. The logic constantly evolved as the app evolved, and we jumped along for that ride, and we certainly came out of it more knowledgeable as budding developers.  


## Features

Our app contains the following features we enjoyed building and hope the user enjoys using:  

<ins>Randomizer button</ins> -- allows user to randomly render information about any random Pokémon.  
<ins>Pokémon of the Day</ins> -- There's always a national day for something, be it donuts, pizza, books, etc. Well, now each Pokémon gets a day, and with this feature you can see the featured Pokémon for that day.  
<ins>MySquad</ins> -- A mini-game feature where user can double-click a Pokémon to catch them and add them to their personal team!  
<ins>PokéJournal</ins> -- A journal text entry section for the user to type notes about Pokémon or any thing else they want to write out. This adds to the user's personal experience.  
<ins>Search History</ins> -- The last three searches will render on the left side buttons of the page for the user to back to when they desire.  
<ins>Did You Know?</ins> -- Renders a silly fun fact about the Pokémon they're viewing; originally derived from Chuck Norris facts.
